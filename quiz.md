1. Some attine ants carry vegetation into their nests and add fungal material, thereby creating “gardens” in which fungal food for the ants grow. Because the ants play the behaviorally active role, it seems compelling to say that they cultivate and control the passive fungi. But even if that is true, the symbiotic association has existed for so long that cultivar traits may have evolved in the fungi that benefit the fungi but not necessarily the ants. Furthermore, many microorganisms have developed sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate the physiology and behavior of their symbiotic animals. It is not implausible, therefore, that the ants’ fungi have evolved chemical and physiological schemes that alter ant behavior to serve the fungus’ reproductive interests, possibly even compromising the reproductive interests for the ant hosts.
    - The passage points out which of the following in order to explain the appeal of the notion that some attine ants cultivate and control fungus?
A. The ants play the behaviorally active roles in the symbiotic relationship.
B. The ants purposefully carry vegetation into their nests for their own consumption.
C. Fungus is physiologically a passive substance.
D. Other organisms are able to manipulate their symbiotic partners.
E. The chemical and physiological properties of the fungus are subject to ant influence.

    - In the context in which it appears, the word “manipulate” most nearly means
A. influence
B. oversee
C. coerce
D. deceive
E. outmaneuver

3. In the 1920s, Gerstmann described a set of problems found in people who have suffered damage to the brain’s left parietal lobe, problems that include being unable to understand arithmetic and having difficulty identifying one’s fingers. There is still no agreement on whether the symptoms Gerstmann noticed constitute a syndrome, but the parts of the brain used for storing facts about numbers and for representing the fingers are close to each other. Mental representations of numbers and of fingers may therefore be functionally connected. A 2005 experiment had people perform some tasks requiring dexterity and others involving matching pairs of numbers, while an area of their parietal lobes—the left angular gyrus—was stimulated by a magnetic field. Facility at both sets of tasks was impaired.

    - The author of the passage would most likely agree that the highlighted statement suggests a flaw in the experiment conducted in 2005 (the parts of the brain used for storing facts about numbers and for representing the fingers are close to each other.)
A. a means by which dexterity might compensate for a loss of arithmetic ability
B. an explanation for some of Gerstmann’s observations
C. an anomaly in some of Gerstmann’s results
D. a reason to doubt damage to the left parietal lobe as a causal factor in certain symptoms

    - The author of the passage describes the "2005 experiment" and its results primarily in order to
A. establish the proximity between the part of the brain used for storing numerical information and the part used for representing the fingers
B. illustrate the implications that Gerstmann’s work may have for experimental research
C. cast doubt on the idea that damage to the left parietal lobe causes the set of problems that Gerstmann described The author of the passage describes the “2005 experiment” and its results primarily in order establish the proximity between the part of the brain used for storing numerical information
D. support a hypothesis about a significant association between parts of the brain related to fingers and to numbers
E. suggest that the problems Gerstmann noted in relation to numbers and fingers have a different cause than the other problems associated with parietal lobe damage

11. Analyzing levels of proportional representation of American Indians in state and local government jobs is important for several reasons. First, the basic idea underlying the theory of representative bureaucracy is that the demographic composition of bureaucracy should mirror the demographic composition of the general public. This is because in addition to its symbolic value, increased access to managerial position may lead to greater responsiveness on the part of policy makers to the policy interests of traditionally disadvantaged groups such as American Indians. Second, the focus on higher level jobs in bureaucracies (as opposed to non-managerial positions) is especially important because managerial positions represent a major source of economic progress for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups, as these jobs confer good salaries, benefits, status, security, and mobility. Third, it is important to know if there has been growth in the American Indian share of more desirable public sector positions over the last two decades. For instance, Peterson and Duncan argue that the population and power of American Indians have been growing in certain states. Peterson and Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian population are becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating into mainstream culture, and securing with greater frequency leadership positions in non-tribal government.

    - The primary purpose of the passage is to
A. summarize a demographic trend overt time
B. present findings on a demographic group
C. analyze the demographic composition of a type of job
D. explain the need for particular social research
E. argue for the implementation of a social policy

    - Which of the following best describes the function of the highlighted sentence in the context of the passage as whole? (Peterson and Duncan also suggest that this growth may reflect the possibility that American Indian population are becoming more active in nontraditional areas of politics, assimilating into mainstream culture, and securing with greater frequency leadership positions in non-tribal government.)
A. It hypothesizes a phenomenon that might explain a point made in the preceding sentence.
B. It provides evidence that undermines that assertion made in the first sentence.
C. It offers a projection regarding the development of a trend mentioned earlier in the passage.
D. It presents an interpretation of a discrepancy noted earlier in the passage.
E. It proposed an implementation of a policy mentioned in the preceding sentence.

    - The passage suggests which of the following regarding “access to managerial positions” for disadvantaged groups?
A. This access is only significant when the percentage of disadvantaged group members in managerial positions mirrors the percent of that group in the general public.
B. This access is largely the result of policy decisions made response to interest of those groups.
C. This access has meaning apart from any policy benefits it confer on those groups.
D. This access often creates increased access to non-managerial position for those groups.
E. The extent of this access tends to be similar across different disadvantaged groups.

12. Columnist: Until very recently, Presorbin and Veltrex, two medications used to block excess stomach acid, were both available only with a prescription written by a doctor. In an advertisement for Presorbin, its makers argue that Presorbin is superior on the grounds that doctors have written 200 million prescriptions for Presorbin, as compared to 100 million for Veltrex. It can be argued that the number of prescriptions written is never a worthwhile criterion for comparing the merits of medicines, but that the advertisement’s argument is absurd is quite adequately revealed by observing that Presorbin was available as a prescription medicine years before Veltrex was.

    - In the columnist’s argument, the two highlighted portions play which of the following roles? (Presorbin is superior)(the advertisement’s argument is absurd)
A. The first is a claim that the columnist’s argument seeks to clarify; the second states a conclusion drawn about one possible interpretation of that claim.
B. The first identifies the conclusion of an argument that the columnist’s argument is directed against; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.
C. The first states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument; the second states a conclusion that the columnist draws in defending that conclusion against an objection.
D. The first identifies an assumption made in an argument that the columnist's argument is directed against; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.
E. The first is a claim that has been offered as evidence to support a position that the columnist opposes; the second states the main conclusion of the columnist’s argument.

13. Madagascar’s Mahafale cattle raisers have incorporated the prickly pear cactus into their pastoral economy, which depends on assisting their cattle through the dry season, when grass and water are scarce. Rather than relying on nomadism in the pursuit of water and pasture for their livestock, they have turned to cactus to keep stock alive. This has influenced the cattle raisers’ way of life, particularly in terms of diet and mobility. Women harvest cactus for their families to eat. Male herders work cactus as a vegetable crop for cattle. For these benefits, pastoralists sow, prune, and shape prickly pear into living fences around their corrals. In doing so, these herders have become cactus cultivators, which has reduced their mobility.

    - Select the sentence in the passage that tells how the prickly pear has affected the Mahafale diet.
A. Madagascar’s Mahafale cattle raisers have incorporated the prickly pear cactus into their pastoral economy, which depends on assisting their cattle through the dry season, when grass and water are scarce.
B. For these benefits, pastoralists sow, prune, and shape prickly pear into living fences around their corrals. In doing so, these herders have become cactus cultivators, which has reduced their mobility.
C. Women harvest cactus for their families to eat.
D. Male herders work cactus as a vegetable crop for cattle.
E. Rather than relying on nomadism in the pursuit of water and pasture for their livestock, they have turned to cactus to keep stock alive.

    - Consider each of the choices separately and select all that apply. Which of the following is mentioned in the passage as an affect of cactus cultivation on the Mahafale’s pastoralist way of life?
A. The Mahafale no longer need to help their cattle survive during the dry season.
B. The Mahafale have abandoned their pastoralist way of life.
C. The mobility of the Mahafale has been diminished.
